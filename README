We all know how difficult it can sometimes be to drag yourself out of bed early in the morning. Optimally, you should get 7.5 or 9 hours of sleep every night, which is equivalent to 5 or 6 sleep cycles. Our product can help you maximize the number of complete sleep cycles you get. You can choose to select a time when you wake up, and the app will compute several suggested times to go to bed to ensure that you donâ€™t wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle. The watch will vibrate at your chosen bedtime to remind you to go to sleep. Or, you can sleep now, and the app will give you options for when to wake up. The watch will vibrate when it is time for you to wake up. This product enhances your typical alarm clock with scientific research about sleep cycles and puts it conveniently on your wrist.

This app was created using the Pebble smartwatch in C during PennApps Winter 2015 by Lucy Chai, Pia Kochar, and Kelly Tan.
